# Car-Information-saver
You are entering the brand and the hs of the car and it saves it in a .txt file so you can see all the cars or delete some of them inside the code.

And I just want to clearify that my codes aren't anything special I just upload them for fun and I use github as a cloud for my codes to never lose them :) HAVE A NÄ°CE DAY
